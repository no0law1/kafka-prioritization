## Exploring Kafka Message Prioritization in .NET: A Proof of Concept and Evaluation

### Overview

This project serves as a hands-on tutorial and proof of concept (POC) for implementing message prioritization in Apache Kafka using .NET. With a focus on understanding the behavior and limitations of partition-based prioritization, the tutorial guides readers through configuring Kafka topics, custom partitioners, and consumers tailored to priority levels (high, medium, low). Through code examples and step-by-step setup, the project showcases how partition assignment can be used to direct high-priority messages to specific consumers.

### Objective

To demonstrate the practicality and potential limitations of using Kafka partitions to achieve message prioritization, ultimately providing insight into whether this approach is suitable for applications requiring prioritized message handling.

### Key Components

**Kafka Environment Setup**

-   Setting up a local Kafka and Zookeeper environment using Docker Compose for easy configuration and testing.

**Producer & Consumer Design**

-   Using custom partitioning strategies in .NET to route messages to specific partitions based on priority levels.

**Consumer Partition Assignment**

-   Configuring consumers to read only from designated partitions per priority, using the Confluent.Kafka library in .NET.

**Evaluation of Partition-Based Prioritization**

-   Analyzing performance, lag management, and challenges in handling varying message rates across priority levels.

## Conclusion:

The article concludes with insights into the limitations of partition-based prioritization, discussing challenges such as consumer lag for lower-priority messages and scalability constraints, and suggesting alternative approaches for high-priority message handling.
